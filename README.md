# Tanoshi - Dummy E-commerce Store

**Tanoshi** is a dummy e-commerce store project created to **learn and practice React, React Router, and modern testing approaches** within the context of an e-commerce application. The app fetches product data from [dummyjson.com](https://dummyjson.com) and demonstrates features like dynamic routing, local storage for cart persistence, and unit testing with modern tools.

## Sidenotes

- This project uses a script from [rafgraph's repo](https://github.com/rafgraph/spa-github-pages) to handle client-side routing when deployed to GitHub Pages. It sets up a custom 404 fallback using `404.html`, ensuring all routes redirect to `index.html` so **React Router** can manage navigation properly.

- The app is configured primarily for devices **1024px and wider**. Optimization for smaller devices has not yet been implemented (the author was feeling a bit lazy).
